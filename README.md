This workspace isolates the Python UAST migration from the Code Scanner application and
the follow-on DL cross-language research work.

`engine/` and `uast/` are Git submodules pinned to official upstream commits. Changes remain focused in their respective repositories so they can be prepared as upstream pull requests.

## Baseline

- `engine/` is pinned to official upstream `249420d`.
- `uast/` is pinned to official upstream `07e3823`.
- The prior local Engine baseline, including C support changes, is preserved in local branch `migration/local-engine-baseline` at `1012bbc`.
- Legacy parser binaries stay outside this workspace and are used only for compatibility baselines.

## Local Setup

Copy `config/local-tools.env.example` to `config/local-tools.env` and adjust paths if necessary. The local file is ignored and must not be committed.

## Layout

- `engine/`: YASA-Engine source and Engine-side integration tests.
- `uast/`: YASA-UAST source; Go/Python parser implementation belongs here.
- `workstreams/yasa-python-migration/`: parser migration documents, baseline scripts and reports.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Private DL cross-language research remains physically available under the local
`workstreams/dl-cross-language-research/` directory, but is deliberately Git-ignored by this
public repository and managed by its own private repository.

See [workstreams/README.md](workstreams/README.md) for the public ownership boundary.
=======
- `workstreams/dl-cross-language-research/`: PyTorch fixtures, DL semantic research and cross-language evaluation code.

See [workstreams/README.md](workstreams/README.md) for ownership boundaries. New generic
fixtures and scripts belong to the relevant workstream instead of a root-level catch-all directory.
